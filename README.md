# Image Classifier using Deep Learning

This repository contains the code and model for an image classifier built using deep learning techniques. The model was developed on Google Colab and is designed to classify images into different categories.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of an image classification model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and is capable of predicting the class of an image with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras
- **Model Architecture:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the Sequential API
- **Training Environment:** Google Colab
- **Data Preprocessing:** Image augmentation, normalization
- **Performance Metrics:** Precision, Recall, Binary Accuracy

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adityajha2005/ImageClassifier_DL.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ImageClassifier_DL
    ```

## Usage

1. **Training the Model:**
   - Upload your dataset to Google Colab.
   - Run the cells in the provided notebook to train the model on your dataset.

2. **Evaluating the Model:**
   - After training, the model's performance can be evaluated using the test dataset.
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, and loss plots are generated to visualize the training process.

3. **Making Predictions:**
   - Load the trained model and use it to make predictions on new images.
   - Example code is provided in the notebook for making predictions.

## Model Details

- **Model Type:** Sequential
- **Architecture:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Layers:**
  - **Conv2D:** 3 convolutional layers with 16, 32, and 16 filters, each with a `(3x3)` kernel size and ReLU activation.
  - **MaxPooling2D:** 3 max pooling layers to down-sample the spatial dimensions.
  - **Flatten:** Converts the 3D output of the last Conv2D layer into a 1D vector.
  - **Dense:** 2 fully connected layers, with 256 neurons in the first layer (ReLU activation) and 1 neuron in the output layer (sigmoid activation for binary classification).
- **Input Shape:** `(256, 256, 3)`
- **Output:** Binary classification (1 neuron with sigmoid activation)
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Loss Function:** Binary Crossentropy
- **Metrics:** Precision, Recall, Binary Accuracy
